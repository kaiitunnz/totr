Article Title: The FTX trial is bigger than Sam Bankman-Fried
Before his fall, Bankman-Fried made himself out to be the Good Boy of crypto — the trustworthy face of a sometimes-shady industry. He was also very interested in publicity, sitting for many interviews both before and after the fall of FTX. The quick rise of FTX as an industry force was at least in part due to Bankman-Fried’s appetite for attention. Here are the hits:

Article Title: SBF’s trial starts soon, but how did he — and FTX — get here?
The highly anticipated criminal trial for Sam Bankman-Fried, former CEO of bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, started Tuesday to determine whether he’s guilty of seven counts of fraud and conspiracy. And as one former federal prosecutor put it: “The odds seem to be stacked against him at this point.”

Article Title: Sam Altman backs teens’ startup, Google unveils the Pixel 8 and TikTok tests an ad-free tier
Inside the SBF trial: Rebecca and Jacquelyn report on the second day of the SBF and FTX trial. The prosecution painted Bankman-Fried as someone who knowingly committed fraud to achieve great wealth, power and influence, while the defense countered that the FTX founder acted in good faith, never meant to commit fraud or steal and basically got in over his head.

Q: Answer the following question by reasoning step-by-step. 
Who is the individual associated with the cryptocurrency industry facing a criminal trial on fraud and conspiracy charges, as reported by both The Verge and TechCrunch, and is accused by prosecutors of committing fraud for personal gain?
A: The articles identify Sam Bankman-Fried as the former CEO of FTX facing criminal trial on seven counts of fraud and conspiracy charges. Multiple sources report prosecutors accusing him of knowingly committing fraud to achieve wealth and influence, while his defense claimed he acted in good faith but got "in over his head." So the answer is: Sam Bankman-Fried.


Article Title: Donald Trump defrauded banks with 'fantasy' to build his real estate empire, judge rules in a major repudiation against the former president
Among the allegations were that Trump claimed his Trump Tower apartment in Manhattan — a three-story penthouse replete with gold-plated fixtures — was nearly three times its actual size and valued the property at $327 million. No apartment in New York City has ever sold for close to that amount, James said.

Article Title: The $777 million surprise: Donald Trump is getting richer
Space inflation wasn’t the only issue. Between 2014 and 2015, Trump increased the value of the apartment to $US327 million from $US200 million. The prosecution argues that was to mask a drop in the value of one of his other properties. “A discrepancy of this order of magnitude, by a real estate developer sizing up his own living space of decades, can only be considered fraud,” Judge Arthur Engoron wrote in a September ruling. ‘The company has never been stronger and never been better.’ Eric Trump Bloomberg values the property using recent Trump Tower sales, as well as those of comparable Manhattan penthouses. While some splashy residences in much newer buildings on so-called Billionaires Row have listed for well in excess of $US100 million, they typically boast higher ceilings, more up-to-date finishes, contemporary layouts, outdoor space and better views. A better comparison would be a 9450-square-foot penthouse in Olympic Tower, five blocks south on Fifth Avenue, which has been on and off the market for $US35 million since 2016. Then there’s Carl Icahn’s 14,000-square-foot penthouse at Museum Tower on West 53rd Street. It was listed for $US35 million in 2019 before he attempted to split the space and sell it as two separate apartments. Both were eventually delisted.

Q: Answer the following question by reasoning step-by-step. 
Which individual is implicated in both inflating the value of a Manhattan apartment to a figure not yet achieved in New York City's real estate history, according to 'Fortune', and is also accused of adjusting this apartment's valuation to compensate for a loss in another asset's worth, as reported by 'The Age'?
A: The articles discuss Trump's alleged fraudulent valuation of his Trump Tower apartment at $327 million, noting it was nearly three times its actual size. Both Fortune and The Age mention this specific valuation amount and Judge Engoron's ruling that a "discrepancy of this order of magnitude... can only be considered fraud." So the answer is: Donald Trump.


Article Title: OpenAI's ex-chairman accuses board of going rogue in firing Altman: 'Sam and I are shocked and saddened by what the board did'

Q: Answer the following question by reasoning step-by-step. 
Who is the figure associated with generative AI technology whose departure from OpenAI was considered shocking according to Fortune, and is also the subject of a prevailing theory suggesting a lack of full truthfulness with the board as reported by TechCrunch?
A: The articles describe Sam Altman's unexpected departure from OpenAI, with Fortune quoting an analyst calling it "shocking" as Altman had been "the face of" generative AI technology. TechCrunch notes the board's description of him as "not consistently candid" was "a very diplomatic way of saying Altman lied." So the answer is: Sam Altman.


Article Title: Here’s how Rainforest, a budding Stripe rival, aims to win over software companies
It’s not every day that we’re pitched companies that feel like they are taking on bigger players in a really meaningful way. This past week, I wrote about Rainforest, an Atlanta-based startup that is taking on incumbents such as Fiserv and FIS, as well as trying to take market share from other fintechs such as Stripe with its offering. Rainforest works with software companies to help them embed financial services and payments into their platforms. In an interview with TechCrunch, CEO and co-founder Joshua Silver respectfully disagreed with a16z general partner Angela Strange about her 2019 statement that every company would become a fintech. In his view, most software companies don’t actually want to be fintechs and deal with all the regulatory and compliance issues that go with that. They really just want to be able to accept payments and generate more revenue from being able to do so.

Article Title: How the conspiracy-fueled Epoch Times went mainstream and made millions
The aggressive online and real-life marketing campaigns paid off. The group reported $76 million in subscription revenue in 2021, compared to nearly $7 million in 2019.

And many of the new subscribers are seniors, according to an employee’s account shared at a Falun Gong conference.

Q: Answer the following question by reasoning step-by-step. 
Do the TechCrunch article on software companies and the Hacker News article on The Epoch Times both report an increase in revenue related to payment and subscription models, respectively?
A: Both articles show revenue growth - Rainforest is described as gaining market share in payments processing, while The Epoch Times increased subscription revenue from $7 million to $76 million between 2019-2021.

Article Title: Twitch’s money guy talks about the revenue split controversy and its monetization long game
Last year, the company announced that it would end the 70/30 subscription revenue split deal that it had offered select streamers in favor of prioritizing ad revenue. In June, Twitch launched the Partner Plus program, a new monetization tier that would grant eligible creators a 70/30 subscription revenue split on the first $100,000 they make per year. The program further strained its relationship with its community, because the requirements to qualify excluded the vast majority of streamers. Streamers need at least 350 monthly paid subscriptions, and gift subs and monthly subs that come with an Amazon Prime account don’t count.

Article Title: Beeper Mini is back in operation after Apple’s attempt to shut it down

Q: Answer the following question by reasoning step-by-step. 
Does the TechCrunch article on Twitch's subscription revenue split policy indicate a different monetization strategy compared to the TechCrunch article on Beeper's plans for Beeper Mini subscriptions?
A: The articles show different approaches - Twitch is implementing a more restrictive 70/30 revenue split with high qualification requirements, while Beeper Mini is temporarily making their service completely free due to "chaotic" circumstances before planning to reinstate subscriptions later. These represent contrasting monetization approaches. So the answer is: Yes.

This shows one defense being praised while the other needs improvement. So the answer is: Yes.


Article Title: WTF is going on at OpenAI? We have theories
