The highly anticipated criminal trial for Sam Bankman-Fried, former CEO of bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, started Tuesday to determine whether he’s guilty of seven counts of fraud and conspiracy. And as one former federal prosecutor put it: “The odds seem to be stacked against him at this point.”

Inside the SBF trial: Rebecca and Jacquelyn report on the second day of the SBF and FTX trial. The prosecution painted Bankman-Fried as someone who knowingly committed fraud to achieve great wealth, power and influence, while the defense countered that the FTX founder acted in good faith, never meant to commit fraud or steal and basically got in over his head.

Article Title: The FTX trial is bigger than Sam Bankman-Fried
Before his fall, Bankman-Fried made himself out to be the Good Boy of crypto — the trustworthy face of a sometimes-shady industry. He was also very interested in publicity, sitting for many interviews both before and after the fall of FTX. The quick rise of FTX as an industry force was at least in part due to Bankman-Fried’s appetite for attention. Here are the hits:

Among the allegations were that Trump claimed his Trump Tower apartment in Manhattan — a three-story penthouse replete with gold-plated fixtures — was nearly three times its actual size and valued the property at $327 million. No apartment in New York City has ever sold for close to that amount, James said.

Article Title: The $777 million surprise: Donald Trump is getting richer
Space inflation wasn’t the only issue. Between 2014 and 2015, Trump increased the value of the apartment to $US327 million from $US200 million. The prosecution argues that was to mask a drop in the value of one of his other properties. “A discrepancy of this order of magnitude, by a real estate developer sizing up his own living space of decades, can only be considered fraud,” Judge Arthur Engoron wrote in a September ruling. ‘The company has never been stronger and never been better.’ Eric Trump Bloomberg values the property using recent Trump Tower sales, as well as those of comparable Manhattan penthouses. While some splashy residences in much newer buildings on so-called Billionaires Row have listed for well in excess of $US100 million, they typically boast higher ceilings, more up-to-date finishes, contemporary layouts, outdoor space and better views. A better comparison would be a 9450-square-foot penthouse in Olympic Tower, five blocks south on Fifth Avenue, which has been on and off the market for $US35 million since 2016. Then there’s Carl Icahn’s 14,000-square-foot penthouse at Museum Tower on West 53rd Street. It was listed for $US35 million in 2019 before he attempted to split the space and sell it as two separate apartments. Both were eventually delisted.

Q: Answer the following question. 
Which individual is implicated in both inflating the value of a Manhattan apartment to a figure not yet achieved in New York City's real estate history, according to 'Fortune', and is also accused of adjusting this apartment's valuation to compensate for a loss in another asset's worth, as reported by 'The Age'?

And if you can survive the moments when things don’t go your way, you can make it.” If you’re not a diehard Game of Thrones fan, Teale’s name may not be familiar.

Article Title: Subtle as a sledgehammer, a pop icon returns
Tate McRae’s career, until recently, had a stench of desperation about it. That’s a wild thing to say about someone who’s only 20, but how else to describe the feeling you get watching an artist who trades explicitly in classic pop moves failing to grab the mode such musical expression necessitates, ie: popularity? Tate McRae’s Think Later: a second stab at superstardom. Despite her age, the Calgary-born musician’s already had a journey. A professionally trained dancer since 6, at 13 she finished third on the US version of So You Think You Can Dance and attracted record label attention with songs uploaded to YouTube. In 2020, her weeper You Broke Me First had a chart moment, leading to her debut I Used To Think I Can Fly in 2022, an intriguing album of thrashy bangers and post-Billie Eilish sad-pop featuring production from pop titans Greg Kurstin (Adele) and Finneas (Eilish). It had at least one could’ve been smash – the spiky What Would You Do? – but, fairly listless despite her swaggering delivery, it failed to ignite with either mainstream audiences or pop aesthetes. But then, this past August, Greedy happened. Used in a video by popular TikToker Tube Girl and then in countless hair-flip transition clips, the song went viral, eventually amassing over 320 million streams globally, topping charts internationally, and becoming McRae’s proper breakthrough and a rare reintroduction. It even landed her a slot on Saturday Night Live, that pop superstar rite-of-passage, and sold out shows for her upcoming Australian tour next November. That Greedy’s the thing that’s pushed McRae to the next level is somewhat confounding. Is it even a good song? It’s not particularly memorable, and McRae’s debut had better tracks that slipped listeners by. But its sassy sentiment – “I would want myself”, particularly suited to clips of youthful coming-of-age expression – clearly caught on with the TikTok crowd, which is how pop stardom happens these days. In another popstar move, McRae also channelled an alter ego (Tatiana, who’s “ballsy, loud and obnoxious”) for Greedy’s vibrant music video, a fun throwback to choreographed Y2K-era aesthetics – McRae dancing all lustily on a Zamboni (so Canadian) – which surely helped.
