Sicilian pizza is pizza prepared in a manner that originated in Sicily, Italy. Sicilian pizza is also known as "sfincione" or focaccia with toppings. In the United States, the phrase "Sicilian pizza" is often synonymous with thick-crust pizza derived from the Sicilian "sfincione" .This type of pizza became a popular dish in western Sicily by the mid-19th century and was the type of pizza usually consumed in Sicily until the 1860s. The version with tomatoes was not available prior to the 17th century. It eventually reached North America in a slightly altered form, with thicker crust and a rectangular shape.

Question: What field of work did the person who first recognized that hydrogen was a discrete substance work in?
Observation 1:
Wikipedia Title: Hydrogen
Hydrogen gas was first artificially produced in the early 16th century, via the mixing of metals with acids. In 1766–81, Henry Cavendish was the first to recognize that hydrogen gas was a discrete substance, and that it produces water when burned, a property which later gave it its name: in Greek, hydrogen means "water-former".

Wikipedia Title: Hydrogen
In 1671, Robert Boyle discovered and described the reaction between iron filings and dilute acids, which results in the production of hydrogen gas. In 1766, Henry Cavendish was the first to recognize hydrogen gas as a discrete substance, by naming the gas from a metal-acid reaction "flammable air". He speculated that "flammable air" was in fact identical to the hypothetical substance called "phlogiston" and further finding in 1781 that the gas produces water when burned. He is usually given credit for its discovery as an element. In 1783, Antoine Lavoisier gave the element the name hydrogen (from the Greek ὑδρο- hydro meaning "water" and -γενής genes meaning "creator") when he and Laplace reproduced Cavendish's finding that water is produced when hydrogen is burned.

Wikipedia Title: Hydrogen
In the same year the first hydrogen-cooled turbogenerator went into service with gaseous hydrogen as a coolant in the rotor and the stator in 1937 at Dayton, Ohio, by the Dayton Power & Light Co.; because of the thermal conductivity of hydrogen gas, this is the most common type in its field today.

Wikipedia Title: Hydrogen
Hydrogen is a chemical element with chemical symbol H and atomic number 1. With an atomic weight of 7000100794000000000♠1.00794 u, hydrogen is the lightest element on the periodic table. Its monatomic form (H) is the most abundant chemical substance in the Universe, constituting roughly 75% of all baryonic mass.[note 1] Non-remnant stars are mainly composed of hydrogen in its plasma state. The most common isotope of hydrogen, termed protium (name rarely used, symbol 1H), has one proton and no neutrons.

Wikipedia Title: Working Lunch
Working Lunch is a television programme broadcast on BBC Two which covers business, personal finance and consumer news, broadcast between 1994 and 2010. The programme was first aired on 19 September 1994. It had a quirky, relaxed style, especially when compared to other BBC business shows such as "World Business Report". In April 2010, the BBC announced that the programme was being cancelled at the end of July 2010. "GMT" with George Alagiah took its place in the schedule at 12:30 on BBC Two.

Wikipedia Title: Work Channel
Work Channel is a channel in the North Coast region of the Canadian province of British Columbia. It lies to the northeast of the Tspimpsean Peninsula. It was named about 1837 by officers of the Hudson's Bay Company after John Work. It was first charted in 1793 by James Johnstone and Robert Barrie, two of George Vancouver's officers during his 1791-95 expedition.
Thought 1: The question is asking about the field of work of the person who first recognized that hydrogen was a discrete substance. From the observation, I see that the person who first recognized hydrogen as a discrete substance is Henry Cavendish. I need to find more information about Henry Cavendish's field of work.
Action 1: Search[Henry Cavendish]
Observation 2:
Wikipedia Title: Henry Cavendish
Henry Cavendish was born on 10 October 1731 in Nice, where his family was living at the time. His mother was Lady Anne de Grey, fourth daughter of Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Kent, and his father was Lord Charles Cavendish, the third son of William Cavendish, 2nd Duke of Devonshire. The family traced its lineage across eight centuries to Norman times, and was closely connected to many aristocratic families of Great Britain. Henry's mother died in 1733, three months after the birth of her second son, Frederick, and shortly before Henry's second birthday, leaving Lord Charles Cavendish to bring up his two sons. Cavendish was styles as "The Honourable Henry Cavendish".From the age of 11 Henry attended Newcome's School, a private school near London. At the age of 18 (on 24 November 1748) he entered the University of Cambridge in St Peter's College, now known as Peterhouse, but left three years later on 23 February 1751 without taking a degree (at the time, a common practice). He then lived with his father in London, where he soon had his own laboratory.

Wikipedia Title: Henry Cavendish
Cavendish died in 1810 (as one of the wealthiest men in Britain) and was buried, along with many of his ancestors, in the church that is now Derby Cathedral. The road he used to live on in Derby has been named after him. The University of Cambridge's Cavendish Laboratory was endowed by one of Cavendish's later relatives, William Cavendish, 7th Duke of Devonshire (Chancellor of the University from 1861 to 1891).

Wikipedia Title: Cavendish Professor of Physics
The Cavendish Professorship is one of the senior faculty positions in physics at the University of Cambridge. It was founded on 9 February 1871 alongside the famous Cavendish Laboratory, which was completed three years later. William Cavendish, 7th Duke of Devonshire endowed both the professorship and laboratory in honor of his relative, chemist and physicist Henry Cavendish.

Wikipedia Title: Cavendish experiment
The Cavendish experiment, performed in 1797–1798 by British scientist Henry Cavendish, was the first experiment to measure the force of gravity between masses in the laboratory and the first to yield accurate values for the gravitational constant. Because of the unit conventions then in use, the gravitational constant does not appear explicitly in Cavendish's work. Instead, the result was originally expressed as the specific gravity of the Earth, or equivalently the mass of the Earth. His experiment gave the first accurate values for these geophysical constants.

Wikipedia Title: Thomas Cavendish
Sir Thomas Cavendish (19 September 1560 – May 1592) was an English explorer and a privateer known as "The Navigator" because he was the first who deliberately tried to emulate Sir Francis Drake and raid the Spanish towns and ships in the Pacific and return by circumnavigating the globe. While members of Magellan's, Loaisa's, Drake's, and Loyola's expeditions had preceded Cavendish in circumnavigating the globe, it had not been their intent at the outset. His first trip and successful circumnavigation made him rich from captured Spanish gold, silk and treasure from the Pacific and the Philippines. His richest prize was the captured 600 ton sailing ship the Manila Galleon "Santa Ana" (also called "Santa Anna"). He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth I of England after his return. He later set out for a second raiding and circumnavigation trip but was not as fortunate and died at sea at the age of 31.
Thought 2: The observation mentions that Henry Cavendish attended the University of Cambridge and later lived with his father in London, where he had his own laboratory. I also see that the Cavendish Professorship of Physics is named after him. This suggests that Henry Cavendish was a physicist.
